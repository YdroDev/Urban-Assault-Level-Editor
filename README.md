# Urban Assault Level Editor

#### A custom-made level editor for old RTS game "Urban Assault" designed with many features that makes it easier to create your own levels.

#### It is now open source and available for everyone so you are welcome to submit pull requests or fork the whole repository.

#### The current state(25.08.2021) of the source code in the main branch is not stable and cannot be compiled yet because it is being refactored. I want to create reausable and easy to extend code for other developers.
